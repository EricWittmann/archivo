# Archivo
Archivo is a cross-platform app for archiving recordings from a TiVo to your computer. It has been designed to "just work" and require very little user input to perform its function.

* Copy recordings from a TiVo to a computer (planned)
* Convert recordings to more convenient video formats (planned)
* Remove commercials from recordings (planned)

## Requirements
* Java 8 (or higher)
* A TiVo Roamio or Premiere (Series 4 and Series 5)
