# Archivo
Archivo is a cross-platform app for archiving recordings from a TiVo to your computer. It is designed to "just work" and require very little user input to perform its function.

## Features
Archivo is currently in development. It is intended to eventually support the following features:

* Automatically identify TiVos on the user's local network
* List available recordings on each identified TiVo
* Copy recordings from a TiVo to a computer (in progress)
* Convert recordings to more convenient video formats (planned)
* Remove commercials from recordings (planned)
* Delete recordings from the TiVo (planned)

## Requirements
* Java 8u40 or higher
* A TiVo Roamio or Premiere (Series 4 and Series 5)
